<h1>The Best Movies According to Mark</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Die Hard</h3>
<p>I like Christmas and this movie allows me to watch a cracking action movie with the excuse of watching a Christmas
    movie.</p>
<h3>Predator</h3>
<p>Fantastic action movie. It comes with all the cheesy lines and I love it.</p>
<h3>Aliens</h3>
<p>There is probably a theme here but no list of action movies would be complete without this masterpiece staring
    Sigourney Weaver.</p>
